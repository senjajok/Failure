You are logged into a fifth-dimensional program used to help fix timelines. 

Fourth-dimensional beings created a program to allow other fourth-dimensional beings to interact with other timelines, with the hope that more timelines can go well and less will be vicious hellscapes. Once a planet signs up for the program, a probe is sent to various timelines until it is seen that a branch ends in mass destruction that can actually be fixed. Then, the probe gains the likeness of the user's choosing that can also blend in with the surrounding society.

The the user gains control of the probe, and has a basic interface. Interaction is limited across timelines, so most things are automated, such as:
- Voice lines are automated as the AI gathers intelligence about what some possible responses would be. It is your job to suss out what answer in different situations would have the reaction you want.
- There is a camera that hovers far above your probe at all times, giving you a skyview of what is going on.
- You can choose what direction your character will go, and there is a button to "interact" with your surroundings. The AI will either naturally interact with the surroundings in a manner that seems appropriate, or give you a list of options as to how to interact.
- Basic 2D RPG menu, let's not go into more detail than needed with inventory, equipment, etc.

They would just let AI's fix the worlds themselves but this continued to lead to a dystopian wasteland. With sentient life, often the timelines are not amazing, but they are not left in bedlam.

--GAME START--

You sign in, and there is a brief guide thanking you for participation in the program. It asks for character design schematics (of which there is a small selection). Your camera comes on skyview over the character you designed, on a beachside. You fuck around learning the controls on the beach while a pre-recorded message goes over all the information above. Apparently, the surrogate used to be dropped off at a location nearest to the space and time of whatever catastrophic or apocalyptic event, but found that the results were more positive if some time-space distance was given first so that users would have a chance to gather intel if needed, and meet/empathize with the population, so as to make a more informed descion on how to stop the catastrophe. After that, it tells you you will hear the world-specific message detailing what the situation is.

The world-specific message is notably darker in tone. You seem to be part of a first trial for this world, as there's not too much information on what it's problems are, what the event is, or how to fix it.
[I will figure in what clues are given in this beginning once I figure out what the problems are myself.]

There is a cliffside nearby so you have to work your way down the beach, and you can do this while listening to the recordings if you want, or stay and practice in the beginning area while listening, that works too.

Then there's this girl.

She looks totally normal. Really a normal, human-looking girl. And she's lost. When you see her, she's looking out over the waves. When she sees you she's scared at first, and retreats into a cave nearby.

CHOICE 1: You go see her in the cave. She's hiding in a corner farthest from the door. You see in the side an empty box labeled rations, otherwise the cave is bare. Upon approaching her, she asks you not to hurt her and to go away. However, when you turn to leave, she calls out for you to wait. She asks where you're going, to which you can answer 
(A) It's nobody's business. 
(B) I don't know. 
(C) Up the path a ways. 
Regardless of what you say, she says she's going to follow you. You can tell her 
(A) I don't want you to. 
(B) That's fine.
(C) I'll try to look out for you.
Again, regardless of what you say, she'll ultimately state that you could kill her if you wanted, but it doesn't matter because she'll die if she stays in this cave any longer. From that point on, she's following you.

CHOICE 2: You ignore her and continue along the path. You start to see some trees and various shrubbery, when you hear someone shout "WAIT" in the distance. She runs up and says she has to come with you. You are presented with the same options as before, but she is more forthcoming now that she has actually had to run after you. She says "They just left me here! And... I starting to think they're not coming back." She says she needs to find civilization or she'll starve to death. Again, regardless of what you say, she is now following you.
